# Zoning for Zero Foundation

### Decarbonizing the Built Environment through Open-Source Urban Morphology.

The **Zoning for Zero Foundation** is a planetary-scale research and infrastructure initiative. We codify the relationship between urban form and climate impact, providing the mathematical standard for carbon-neutral cities.

## 🏛 The Mission: Strategic Agility for a Climate Emergency

Urban planning decisions regarding land use, multi-modal connectivity, and structural density create **path-dependencies** that dictate the carbon intensity of cities for decades. We believe that **decisions made at the planning level hold significantly greater decarbonization potential than granular building-level refinements.**

Our goal is to move the built environment sector from a fixation on construction-phase hyper-precision toward **Strategic Agility**—leveraging high-impact urban planning data (UPD) to drive systemic change.

## 🧬 Our Open Core Strategy: The "Math Contract"

We maintain a strict boundary between public utility and commercial innovation:
* **The Foundation** defines the **Math Contract**: standardized schemas and computational logic for climate proxies.
* **The Ecosystem** (Commercial Partners) handles **Delivery**: building the APIs, visualizations, and end-user services that power the transition.

## 📂 The Ecosystem

* **[zzproxies](https://github.com/zoning-for-zero/zzproxies):** Our production-grade Python engine. Modular, schema-driven, and infrastructure-agnostic.
* **[datalab](https://github.com/zoning-for-zero/datalab):** The research hub where we bridge raw spatial data (Overture Maps, Urban Atlas) with new zoning ordinances and policy innovation.

## ⚖️ Governance & Integrity

The Foundation is governed by a **Scientific Advisory Board** to ensure that every proxy in our registry meets the highest standards of mathematical and environmental validity. 

> **"The math of our planet should be smart, open, and simple to leverage."**
