# Climate Proxy 1

## Introduction

This document describes Climate Proxy 1 (CX1) and its application in our research.

## Description

Climate proxies are preserved physical characteristics of the past that enable scientists to reconstruct the climatic conditions over Earth's history.

### CX1 Characteristics

- **Type**: Primary climate indicator
- **Time Scale**: Long-term historical data
- **Geographic Coverage**: Global
- **Resolution**: High temporal resolution

## Data Analysis

The relationship between proxy data and climate variables can be expressed as:

$$
T(t) = \alpha \cdot P(t) + \beta
$$

Where:
- $T(t)$ is the temperature at time $t$
- $P(t)$ is the proxy measurement
- $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are calibration parameters

## Applications

CX1 data is used for:

1. Historical climate reconstruction
2. Model validation
3. Future climate projections
4. Policy recommendations
