# Methodology

## Overview

This section describes the research methodology used by the Zoning for Zero Foundation.

## Research Approach

Our methodology is based on rigorous scientific principles and data analysis.

### Key Components

1. **Data Collection** - Systematic gathering of relevant data
2. **Analysis** - Application of statistical and analytical methods
3. **Validation** - Peer review and verification processes
4. **Documentation** - Comprehensive recording of findings

## Mathematical Framework

We use LaTeX for mathematical equations. For example:

$$
E = mc^2
$$

The equation above demonstrates the energy-mass equivalence.

### Statistical Analysis

Our statistical approach includes:

$$
\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \mu)^2}{n}}
$$

Where $\sigma$ represents the standard deviation.
