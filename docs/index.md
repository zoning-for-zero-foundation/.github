# Welcome to Zoning for Zero Foundation

The **Zoning for Zero Foundation** is a planetary-scale research and infrastructure initiative. We codify the relationship between urban form and climate impact, providing the mathematical standard for carbon-neutral cities.

## The Mission: Strategic Agility for a Climate Emergency

Urban planning decisions regarding land use, multi-modal connectivity, and structural density create **path-dependencies** that dictate the carbon intensity of cities for decades. We believe that **decisions made at the planning level hold significantly greater decarbonization potential than granular building-level refinements.**

Our mission is to move the industry beyond the ’precision paradox’ of construction-level data toward **Strategic Agility** by bridging the gap between planetary climate research and enforceable, mitigative zoning standards.
